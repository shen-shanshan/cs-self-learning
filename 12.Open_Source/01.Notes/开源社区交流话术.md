**Contributor:**

I have provided a draft version of the VLLM, with the following key changes:

1. Protocol changes: Aligned with OpenAI /v1/audio/speech.
2. Removed the custom inference part, keeping the inference logic consistent between streaming and non-streaming.
3. Optimized some potential issues of inconsistency caused by streaming inference.

These changes may have a significant impact. Feel free to leave comments to guide me in further improvements.
