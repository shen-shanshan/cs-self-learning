/open-source-engineer-schedule-planning-master
I'm an open source engineer, please help me to plan my schedule for the next week.
I want to focus on the vllm-project/vllm and vllm-project/vllm-ascend repositories, especially on multi-modal, structured output and elastic scaling modules.
My GitHub username is shen-shanshan.
I have the following tasks to include in my schedule:
1. Optimize Qwen3-VL performance with priority 1 and a deadline of April 1, 2026. This may last for about 2 weeks.
2. Resolve issues related to multi-modal models, such as VL, Omni, OCR models or directly assigned to me in vllm-ascend with priority 2.
3. Review PRs related to multi-modal models in vllm-ascend with priority 3.
4. Keep up with recent news about large language models and their applications with priority 4.
