## Parallelism

A key motivation for DP attention is reduced memory footprint in MLA models like DeepSeek V2, V3, and R1. If Tensor Parallelism is used in an MLA model, we duplicate the KV cache across GPUs, wasting memory. This reduces our batch size for throughput and high-QPS serving use cases, which kills our performance.

```python
self.n_redundant_experts = parallel_config.num_redundant_experts
self.n_logical_experts = self.n_routed_experts
self.n_physical_experts = self.n_logical_experts + self.n_redundant_experts
self.n_local_physical_experts = self.n_physical_experts // self.ep_size

self.physical_expert_start = self.ep_rank * self.n_local_physical_experts
self.physical_expert_end = self.physical_expert_start + self.n_local_physical_experts
```
